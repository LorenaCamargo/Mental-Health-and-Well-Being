## Background
This project explores the relationship between global happiness and mental health indices, aiming to understand how different dimensions of human well-being manifest around the world.

Using international public data, a project was developed that combines interactive visualizations with data analysis to identify patterns, contrasts, and correlations that are often not immediately evident and that can assist regional and global public policies.

This case study is part of the research developed during the Master's degree in Business Analytics, more specifically as part of the Data Visualization course.
