## Background
This project explores the relationship between global happiness and mental health indices, aiming to understand how different dimensions of human well-being manifest around the world.

Using international public data, a project was developed that combines interactive visualizations with data analysis to identify patterns, contrasts, and correlations that are often not immediately evident and that can assist regional and global public policies.

This case study is part of the research developed during the Master's degree in Business Analytics, more specifically as part of the Data Visualization course.

## Executive Summary
#### The relationship between happiness and mental health is not universal
The analysis revealed a correlation of -0.07 between the happiness index and the quality of mental health in the countries analyzed, indicating that the relationship between these two variables is not necessarily linear and universal, suggesting the possible interference of cultural and socioeconomic aspects.

#### Wealth does not guarantee happiness
Although per capita income appears as the main structural factor associated with overall happiness, the strongest correlation is observed with social support. This suggests that, while money creates conditions for well-being, what sustains the perception of happiness is the network of support and interpersonal relationships.

#### Adaptive well-being stands out in contexts of lower overall happiness 
Emotional intelligence and resilience are more prevalent in countries with high levels of mental health, even if they have a lower happiness index. This pattern, especially evident in Southeast Asia and Latin America, indicates that emotional balance and a sense of purpose can flourish even in contexts of lower subjective satisfaction.

## Insights Deep Dive
### 1. Happiness and Mental Health
When analyzing the graph showing the distribution of countries in terms of happiness and mental health, a greater concentration was expected in quadrants Q1 (higher happiness and higher mental health) and Q3 (lower happiness and lower mental health). However, the result revealed a uniform distribution among the quadrants, suggesting that the relationship between happiness and mental health is not universal (which is reinforced by the correlation of -0.07 found).

This lack of a clear correlation can be explained by factors such as:
- The subjective nature of the happiness index;
- Cultural differences, which influence perceptions of what it means to be happy and what is valued in mental well-being;
- The fact that both happiness and mental health result from multiple factors, not always directly related to each other.

<br> 

In general:
- Countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia are among those that best balance happiness and mental health (Q1)
- Countries in Western Europe and North America are among those with the highest levels of happiness, but lower mental health (Q2)
- Countries in the Middle East and North Africa are the ones that present the most difficulties in terms of happiness and mental health (Q3)
- Sub-Saharan African countries show good mental health, despite a low happiness index (Q4)

### 2. Happiness moderators

There is a distinction between the weight and correlation of the factors that make up the happiness index.
GDP appears as the factor with the greatest weight in happiness indices, however, social support shows a stronger correlation.

<br> 

This result highlights that the economic factor is a structural factor that most affects the others, given its correlation with the other factors. This means that this factor can be understood as a basic determinant, explaining much of the variability in indices around the world, but it does not always move linearly with happiness.
In contrast, the high correlation between happiness and social support suggests that what sustains the perception of happiness is the quality of relationships and social support.

This difference is mainly observed between countries with higher or lower happiness indices.

<br> 

In general, in countries with higher happiness indices, the economic factor has four times more significance than social support compared to countries with lower GDP. This suggests that lower-income countries seek greater support from the social side to structure their well-being, which is an important factor in defining public policies.

### 3. Mental health moderators

The analysis revealed that adaptability and resilience are the factors with the greatest weight in determining overall mental health. These elements function as structural pillars, supporting emotional balance in the face of adversity.

However, the strongest direct correlation with mental health was observed in mood & outlook, followed by social self and resilience. This pattern indicates that, although mood and sociability reflect the current state of mental health, it is the deeper emotional competencies (such as resilience and adaptability) that protect and maintain it over time.

<br>

The analysis also showed that countries with lower happiness indices stand out as having better results in almost all aspects that make up mental health, except for the level of cognition (possibly motivated by the educational opportunities that higher GDPs provide).

This pattern suggests that economically unstable contexts can be good shapers of characteristics such as adaptability and resilience and that, in these contexts, the notion of well-being translates into emotional strength and the individual's interaction with the collective.

### 4. Regional characteristics

**Africa**\
Balances financial and social aspects in the definition of happiness, although its mental health depends heavily on collective experiences. The region expresses a deeply communal culture, which, even in the face of economic and social challenges, demonstrates emotional maturity and resilience in the face of adversity.

**Asia**\
Although the economic factor has significant weight in the definition of happiness, the region demonstrates a rational and introspective approach to well-being. It values ​​cognitive development and the connection between mind and body, suggesting a culture that associates well-being with internal personal improvement, without disregarding the importance of material conditions.

**Europe**\
Prioritizes economic aspects over social ones as the basis for well-being. The region reflects a more individualistic and reserved culture, which values ​​personal development and financial stability as pillars of happiness, while social support plays a secondary role in the perception of satisfaction.

**Latin America**\
Assigns balanced weight to financial and social factors in the perception of happiness, but its mental health is strongly linked to interpersonal relationships. The region expresses a collectivist and emotionally expressive culture, which finds its main source of well-being and psychological support in social connection and empathy.

**Middle East**\
Presents relatively low levels of happiness and mental health, but stands out for its resilience and future-oriented motivation. It prioritizes the economic aspect in the definition of well-being and reflects an adaptive culture that seeks strength and purpose in overcoming challenges and in the hope of progress.

**North America**\
The economic aspect largely predominates over social support, and interpersonal interactions have limited influence on the perception of happiness. This configuration reflects a strongly individualistic culture, where well-being is anchored in financial achievement and personal autonomy, more than in collective relationships.


## Recommendations

- It is recommended to extend the observation period for happiness and mental health indicators, incorporating new measurements over time. This will allow for the identification of structural trends, such as the impact of population aging, economic changes, or technological advancements on overall well-being.
<br>

- It is also recommended to expand the demographic granularity of the data, incorporating other measures such as age group, educational level, and urbanization. This will allow the identification of how well-being varies among different population profiles and, consequently, will enable the development of more effective public policies.
<br>
   
- Until the previous recommendations can be implemented, it is recommended that any strategies for promoting happiness and mental health be contextualized by culture, values, and social structure, avoiding universal approaches. Furthermore, it is recommended that countries seek out similar contexts to identify best practices in promoting happiness and mental health.
