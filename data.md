Before conducting the analysis, a data quality check was performed, and standardization adjustments were made to country names to ensure that the relationships between tables could be properly established.

This validation confirmed the consistency and reliability of the data for the proposed analysis.

The relationships between datasets were established within Tableau, using country and year as key fields to enable consistent joins across data sources.
